<h1> Nomad </h1>
Nomad is a single binary that schedules applications and services on Linux, Windows, and Mac. It is an open source scheduler that uses a declarative job file for scheduling virtualized, containerized, and standalone applications.
<ul>
<li><b>Declare jobs</b><br/>
Users compose and submit high-level job files. Nomad handles the scheduling and upgrading of the applications over time.

This flexibility makes it easy to deploy one container, dozens of containers, or even millions.
</li>
<li><b>Plan changed</b><br/>
With built-in dry-run execution, Nomad shows what scheduling decisions it will take before it takes them. Operators can approve or deny these changes to create a safe and reproducible workflow.
</li>
<li><b>Run applications</b><br/>
Nomad runs applications and ensures they keep running in failure scenarios. In addition to long-running services, Nomad can schedule batch jobs, distributed cron jobs, and parameterized jobs.
</li>
<li><b>Monitor progress</b><br/>
Stream logs, send signals, and interact with the file system of scheduled applications. These operator-friendly commands bring the familiar debugging tools to a scheduled world.</li>
</ul>
